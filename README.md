# MultiplayerPokemonClone

For those who want to give it a try, I include executables for both Windows and Mac here. :smile:

â€¢ Executables: [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A8jwrD3OYHka7ypnvm38ThLNdIEG-box/view?usp=share_link) <-> [Mac](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UrhgccSkpsYo2jcZEqkREPYYQsNjc1kl/view?usp=share_link)

This project is a tech demo of a 2D multiplayer Pokemon game, where you can fight wild enemies in the grass,
and challenge other players to battle when you get close to them.

This demo was developed in Unity, using freely licensed assets for the artwork.
The Photon 2 library was used for the multiplayer part.

To play, all you have to do is start the game and create a room or join an existing one 
(the rooms have unique names, so the names cannot be repeated until the room disappears).

Also, as far as I know, Photon does not allow cross-platform play, so don't try it.
