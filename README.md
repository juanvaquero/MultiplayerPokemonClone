# MultiplayerPokemonClone

The repository includes an executables of the demo for both Mac and Windows for those who want to try it. :smile:

This project is a tech demo of a 2D multiplayer pokemon game,
in which you can have fights with wild enemies in the grass,
and challenge other players to a battle if you get close to them.

This demo has been developed in Unity using free licensed assets for the artwork.
For the multiplayer section the **Photon 2** library has been used.

To be able to play you simply have to start the game, and create a room,
or join one that has already been created (the rooms have unique names, 
and therefore the names cannot be repeated, until the room disappears). 

Also, Photon does not allow cross-platform play that I have discovered, so don't try it.
